# Day Two Individual Exercises

## Exercise 1
Currently, if the user sends a message of "hello", the bot will respond with "hi!"  
Instead, the bot should respond with "howdy!"

## Exercise 2
If the user sends a message of "goodbye", the bot should respond with "bye!"

*HINT: Copy the if block for "hello", this should be quite similar*

## Exercise 3
If the user sends a message that *starts with* the word "help", the bot should respond with "sorry, I can't help you."

## Exercise 4
Add the ability for the bot to repeat a message from the user.
  
- If the bot recieves a message starting with "!repeat", that message should be sent back to the user
- This should happen in a new `repeat` method, you will have to define and call it
- Bonus for removing the "!repeat " from the beginning of the message

*HINT: This will be similar to the multiply command*
