# Day One Guide
Day One is all about introducing the basics of programming. It should start with an overview of Python, followed by some activities designed to teach the students how to use Python at a basic level.

## Icebreaker Activity - Lines and Blobs
The purpose of the icebreaker is to warm up the students, and let them get to know each other a little bit. There is a PowerPoint containing instructions for the Lines and Blobs activity (`IceBreakerMain.pptx`). Students will group themselves together based on various personal characteristics. This should take 5-10 minutes.


## Lecture - PowerPoint presentation with code examples
This is where the learning begins. The lecture should cover:
1. What Python is as a programming language
1. "Hello World" program (`print` function) *(note: instructors should show this running)*
1. Printing other messages
1. Variables
1. `input` function
1. Code comments
1. Conditionals
1. Numbers (including conversion using the `int` function)
1. Math using numbers
1. Comparisons using numbers (operators <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
1. Functions (defining and calling)

The Lecture is split up into two parts. After completing the first part, the instructors should go over the first part of the Follow Along. Similarly, after completing the entire lecture, the instructors should finish out the rest of the Follow Along.

### Notes
- We should emphasize indentation for conditionals and functions
- We should emphasize the need for quotes when creating strings


## Follow-Along Coding - Fortune Teller
This is where the students start to write their own code. Here, the students *should* type along with the instructor. The instructor should start by creating a blank python file, and then building it up into `FollowAlong1.py` (and eventually `FollowAlongComplete.py`). Throughout the activity, the instructor should call on students randomly and ask them what to type. The instructor should explain each part of the code, and allow students to ask questions.

The instructor should start by explaining the basic premise of the program: a fortune teller will ask a variety of questions, and then calculate the user's lifespan.

### Steps
#### Part 1
1. Print out the first message saying "I am the fortune teller"
1. Set the intial lifespan variable
1. Add the print at the end to tell the user their lifespan
    (Use the `str` function to convert the lifespan to a string)
1. Ask the user if they like bananas, store result in variable
1. If their answer was yes, add 20 years to their lifespan
1. Ask the user for their astrological sign, store it in a variable
1. Create the if structure for the astrological sign (Libra +5)
1. Ask the user how old they are
1. Convert their age to a number using the `int` function
1. Perform the calculation `25 - age` on their age
1. Add the result of the calculation to the lifespan

#### Part 2
1. Finish out the else/elif structure for the astrological sign question
1. Convert the age calculation into a function

1. Define and call a function doing the `25 - age` calculation


## Kahoot Quiz
The Kahoot Quiz covers the content from the Lecture/Follow-Along. The instructor should project the main page, and the students should be able to connect play from their computers. The top 3 should receive candy for their efforts.

## Individual Coding
This is where students will actually write code individually, without the instructor telling them what to type. During this time, the instructors should walk the room and help the students who require assistance.

The starting code for this activity is from the `Individual2.py` file. The instructions for the exercises are found in `Individual2Instructions.html`.


## Challenges
This is for the students who complete the Individual Coding before the end of class. There should be a good number of challenges so the students do not run out of things to do. The challenges should be self-contained, independent from the rest of the content.
