# Day One Challenges

## Two Names
Ask the user for two names and print out "Hello, ___ and ___" (printing the names instead of the blanks).  
If you don't know how to start, look back at `helloName.py` when we asked for one name.

## Math Checker
Ask the user a math problem and tell them if their answer is correct or incorrect.  
When you get the user's input, it will be a string. To change it to a number, use `myNumber = int(userInput)`

*HINT: You don't have to change their answer to a number to see if they are correct*

## Printer Function
Create a function that prints a message to the console.  
*Call* the function so that the message is printed when you *run* the code.

## If with Math
The code below does not print anything.  
Change the `if` statement so that it will print what it's supposed to.

Then, change it to something different that will still print "Yay math :)"  
Experiment with different `if` statements to see if they are `true` or `false`.

```python
if(2 + 2 == 5):
    print("Yay math! :)")
```

## Movie Theater
Ask the user for their age.

- If the user is under 14, print "You are too young to see this movie"
- If the users age is between 14 a 16 print "You might be mature enough but ask your parents first"
- If the users age is 17 and up print "You are old enough for this movie have some popcorn on the house"


## Table for 2?
You and your friends went to dinner and now it's time to pay. Everyone agrees to spit the bill evenly.

- Ask the user how many people were dining
- Ask the user how much was their total bill was
- Tell the user how much each person has to pay

*HINT: Divide the total bill by the number of people dining*

**BONUS:** Include the tax into how much each person pays (20% tax)

## Money in the Bank
Welcome to the Hyland International bank (start each person with 200 dollars).

- Ask the user how much money they would like to withdraw.
- If the user asks for more money than they have in their account, let them know that they can't take that much money out
- After the user takes money out of their account, tell them their new balance 

## Guess My Number
Have the user enter a number.

- If the user guesses right, print "Yah you guessed my number"
- If the user guesses wrong print "Better Luck Next Time"

**BONUS:** Have the user keep guessing until they guess the number correctly

## Concert Ticket Prices
Regular tickets are $20  
Kids under 13 are $10  
Seniors (60 and older) are $15

VIP access doubles the ticket price.

- Ask the user for their age
- Ask the user if they want VIP access
- Tell the user how much their ticket costs

## Function with parameters
Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and adds them together.  
*Call* your function to solve an addition problem, then print out the answer.

## Two Functions Number Game
- Ask the user to input two numbers (***HINT:** Ask for the first number, then ask for the second number*)  
- Ask the user if they want to add or multiply the two numbers
- If they choose "add", add the numbers
- If they choose "multiply" multiply the numbers
- Display the final answer to the user.

**BONUS:** Add the numbers in a function called `add`, and multiply the numbers in a function called `multiply`
